dotfiles
====================
dotfiles for Linux/BSD/Cygwin.

`vimrc` and `gvimrc` are also used by Vim on Windows.
Refer to the `dotfiles_w` repository for what is used on Windows only.


Installation
--------------------
```bash
git clone https://github.com/curipha/dotfiles.git
./dotfiles/_setup.sh
```

or

```bash
git clone git@github.com:curipha/dotfiles.git
./dotfiles/_setup.sh
```


Remarks
--------------------
### bash_profile
Hide bash and run zsh.
I made it because there was an environment where it could not `chsh`.
